 * Takeoff and initial climb, FBW A380X SOP (3 DEC 2021), chapter "Takeoff":
 *
 * - PF | TAKEOFF ... ANNOUNCE
 * - Before reaching 80 knots: PM | THRUST SET ... ANNOUNCE
 * - At 100 knots: PM | ONE HUNDRED KNOTS ... ANNOUNCE
 * - At V1 speed: PM | V1 ... MONITOR or ANNOUNCE
 * - At VR speed: PM | ROTATION ... ORDER
 * - When positive climb: PM | POSITIVE CLIMB ... ANNOUNCE (vertical speed positive and radio altitude increased)
 *   PF | LANDING GEAR UP ... ORDER, PM | LANDING GEAR ... UP
 * - Above the acceleration altitude, at F speed (not for CONFIG 1+F): PF | FLAPS 1 ... ORDER, PM | FLAPS 1 ... SET
 * - At S speed: PF | FLAPS ZERO ... ORDER, PM | FLAPS ZERO ... SET
 *
 * Not covered yet: rolling/standing takeoff thrust technique (PF), chronometer, exterior lights, ground spoilers,
 * packs, APU, TCAS and the after takeoff/climb checklist.
